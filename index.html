                        Just a regular guy trying to make it in life, but if you must know - keep reaading. My story begins in a city called Cali, Colombia. I was born and raised in Colombia until the age of 6.
                         At which point my grandfather passed away and things make a turn for the better if you will.
                         My mother decided that given the current conditions with the famil and with Colombia at the time, that it was best for us to have a chnage in scenery and this is when we moved to good old Elizabeth, NJ.
                        While in the States I began to excercise my passion for soccer, the outdoors, and personal growth. Growing up I enjoyed traveling all over the country playing in soccer games and tournaments.
                        Soccer allowed me to attend a prestigous High School known for their soccer program. While in my Junior year of High School I took an elective called "Intro to Javascript" (not sure what I was thinking) and I fell in love.
                        I went on to finish the class as the only one to receive an "A" for the course, which allowed me to be the recepeint for the highest academmic achievment award at school in Computer Science.
                        Since then I have always been intrugued by technology. However, I went on to College at Rutgers Univesrity and decided to pursue Finance as I also had a passion for money.
                         In deed I quickly found out the hard way that money does not buy happiness so I switched majors to IT Project Management - I felt at home. 
                         I knew I needed to be in the Tech Industry, more specificly combining my Finance background and my passion for technology.
                         Luckily I was able to get an Internship at a Bank that turned into a full time position at their Technology Department and this is where my professional career beings and the reason for me joing the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
